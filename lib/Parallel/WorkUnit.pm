=head1 SYNOPSIS

  my $wu = Parallel::WorkUnit->new();
  $wu->async( sub { ... }, \&callback );

  $wu->waitall();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This is a very simple forking implementation of parallelism, with the
ability to pass data back from the asyncronous child process in a
relatively efficient way (with the limitation of using a pipe to pass
the information, serialized, back).  It was designed to be very simple
for a developer to use, with the ability to pass reasonably large amounts
of data back to the parent process.

There are many other Parallel::* applications in CPAN - it would be worth
any developer's time to look through those and choose the best one.

=method async( sub { ... }, \&callback )

Spawns work on a new forked process.  The forked process inherits
all Perl state from the parent process, as would be expected with
a standard C<fork()> call.  The child shares nothing with the
parent, other than the return value of the work done.

The work is specified either as a subroutine reference or an
anonymous sub (C<sub { ... }>) and should return a scalar.  Any
scalar that L<Storable>'s C<freeze()> method can deal with
is acceptable (for instance, a hash reference or C<undef>).

When the work is completed, it serializes the result and streams
it back to the parent process via a pipe.  The parent, in a
C<waitall()> call, will call the callback function with the
unserialized return value.

Should the child process C<die>, the parent process will also
die (inside the C<waitall()> method).

The PID of the child is returned to the parent process when
this method is executed.

Note: on Windows with threaded Perl, threads instead of forks are used.
See C<thread> for the caveats that apply.  The PID returned is instead
a meaningless (outside of this module) counter, not associated with any
Windows thread identifier.

=method waitall()

Called from the parent method while waiting for the children
to exit.  This method handles children that C<die()> or return
a serializable data structure.  When all children return, this
method will return.

If a child dies unexpectedly, this method will C<die()> and propagate a
modified exception.

sub waitall {
    if ( $#_ != 0 ) { confess 'invalid call'; }
    my ($self) = @_;

    # Tail recursion
    if ( $self->waitone() ) { goto &waitall }
}

=method waitone()

This method similarly to C<waitall()>, but only waits for
a single PID.  It will return after any PID exits.

If this method is called when there is no processes executing,
it will simply return undef. Otherwise, it will wait and then
return 1.

=method wait($pid)

This functions simiarly to C<waitone()>, but waits only for
a specific PID.  See the C<waitone()> documentation above
for details.

If C<wait()> is called on a process that is already done
executing, it simply returns.  Otherwise, it waits until the
child process's work unit is complete and executes the callback
routine, then returns.

=head1 BUGS

Windows doesn't do C<fork()>, but emulates it with threads.  As a result,
any thread unsafe library is going to cause problems with Windows.  In
addition, all the normal thread caveats apply - see L<threads> for more
information.

In addition, this code is unlikely to function properly on a Windows without
threaded Perl.
