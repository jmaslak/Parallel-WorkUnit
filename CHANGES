1.012 - Oct 26, 2017
 * Minor test updates

1.011 - Oct 26, 2017
 * Worker pool implication
 * Minor documentation changes
 * Released as DEV version

1.010 - Jun 22, 2016
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Add Travis CI configuration
 * Change author name

1.009 - Apr 23, 2016
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Switched from TryCatch to Try::Tiny to maintain compatibility
   with Perl 5.24.0-RC1 (TryCatch depends on Scope::Upper which
   was broken by perl core changes)

1.008 - Mar 13, 2016
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Win32: Really fix the compatibility issue.  There is no
   select() on Win32 that works with sockets, so we simulate
   this with Thread::Queue (Thanks, CPAN Testers!)

1.007 - Mar 7, 2016
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Win32: Fix Win32 compatibility issue introduced in 1.006.
   (Thanks, CPAN Testers!)
 * Win32: waitone() no longer waits only for the first running
   thread to stop but waits instead for the first finishing
   thread.

1.006 - Mar 2, 2016
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Add waitone() method, which allows you to wait for one and exactly
   one child thread to return.  This is useful in building worker
   pools.
 * Add count() method, which returns the number of outstanding
   threads running or waiting to send output.  This is also usesful
   for building worker pools.

1.005 - July 15, 2015
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * This version doesn't have any functionality changes from 1.002
 * This beats up the smoke tests hosts (particularly Windows and
   Solaris) a lot less, by spawning fewer processes during tests.

1.004 - July 13, 2015
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Correct missing tests in 1.003

1.003 - July 13, 2015
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * This version doesn't have any functionality changes from 1.002
 * A test failed on some shells due to insecure $ENV in taint mode
 * Minor documentation changes

1.002 - July 12, 2015
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Windows compatibility fixes
 * Don't use SIG{CHLD} = 'IGNORE'
     (bug 105823, reported by SREZIC)
 * Relaxed Perl minimum version requirements
     (bug 105824, reported by SREZIC)
 * Returned better error messages in cases where freeze() fails
     (bug 105825, reported by SREZIC)
 * Minor code cleanup/formatting

1.001 - July 12, 2015
Joelle Maslak <jmaslak@antelope.net>
 * Changed behavior for reads, so that the return value can be ready by
   multiple read() calls.  This aids robustness if a signal comes in at
   a bad time, particularly in Perl 5.14.
